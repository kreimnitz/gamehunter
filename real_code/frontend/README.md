# GameHunter Front-End
I've created this "Hello World" code and configured the repo to load onto GCP Cloud Build/Cloud Run in the GameHunter project. It builds in about 1 minute (currently) and loads automatically. Simply push changes to the master branch in the repo and it is built. Pushes to feature branches shouldn't trigger a build.

Note: if you change the repo structure, then the cloud build function needs to change as well.
